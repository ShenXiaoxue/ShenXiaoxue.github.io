Hi there! My name is Xiaoxue (it means 'Snow' in Chinese). I am currently a postdoc researcher at the Alan Turing Institute researching on digital twins. I joined the TRIC-DT team at Turing in Oct 2023, working with Professor David Wagg. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD at the Acoustics Research Unit of the University of Liverpool and I have been advised by Professor Carl Hopkins.

My research interest lie in Acoustics, Structure-borne sound, Knowledge Graphs, Digital Twins.
